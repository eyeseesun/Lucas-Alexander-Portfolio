# My Portfolio

##How to run

```
npm install
ng serve
```

Wow, so complicated.

## What I learned

- I have a lot more portfolio pieces than this and want to add them.

## What I used

- **Angular**
- **Filezilla for ftp**
- **Photoshop for initial design and photo editing**

## What I would love to add

- My github, linked in, and daily ui as icons at the bottom of the page, and the top????
- More of my portfolio pieces I've done
