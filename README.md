# My Portfolio

## How to run

```
npm install
ng serve
```

Wow, so complicated.

## What I learned

- I have way more skills than I thought I did.
- I have a lot more portfolio pieces than this and want to add them.
- CSS transitions are fun, as always.
- Don't name your css based off of one of its attribute. If you change that attribute for whatever reason, your naming convention no longer makes sense.


## What I used

- **Angular**
- **Filezilla for ftp**
- **Photoshop for initial design and photo editing**

## What I would love to add

- My github, linked in, and daily ui as icons at the bottom of the page, and the top????
- More of my portfolio pieces I've done
- I need to find a better way to check mobile for determining which component to use. It smells funny. I mean, maybe the css pseudo class after for adding images? That feels a bit weird cause it makes the html dependent on the css, right?
